## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've realized that with every new challenge Flexbox and CSS Grid become a bit easier to use. I really like the progress that I've seen, and how satisfying can be to finish a proyect. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I'm in the right path.

### Continued development

I have a hard time with the layout when using media queries, so my projects can look a bit woonky when I'm not following a design (you can see it with this project at 1024px). I'm going to check some resources online so I can work on some cool layouts.
